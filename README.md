# AOS-Create
An powerful IDE for Creating Applications for AOS Desktop, Mobile "(in this case an alternitive to Android Studio)", and your own projects
When you want to run AOS Create from source code, assuming you have node.js and npm "(Comes preinstalled with node.js on windows)" run on your command prompt / terminal
```bash
npm install
```
We did that step because we need to download the right dependencies for each platform, so our app will work. To run the app after that, type again in the command prompt / terminal
```bash
npm start
```
